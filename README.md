# RIS
#Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface/System are reflective elements used to tune signal properties, mainly phase shifts in order to obtain better transmission in areas with obstructions, imperfect channels etc.
by acting as a link between the transmitter and receiver, RIS can improve rate, received power and other characteristics.
The aim of this project is to model an RIS system for imperfect channel state information (CSI) in MATLAB
